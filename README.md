# NBA-Draft-Analysis

Welcome to the NBA Draft Analysis Notebook. In this notebook, we delve into the NBA draft dataset, uncovering insights and patterns that shed light on the performance of draft picks and their potential for success.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

* We kick off our analysis by thoroughly cleaning the dataset, addressing issues like missing values and inconsistencies in team names.
* Our EDA journey takes us through a series of visualizations and graphs, revealing the dynamics of different statistical categories across teams, draft positions, and draft years.
* We explore the top 25 universities with the most drafted players, offering a glimpse into the institutions that have made a significant impact on the NBA.

## Success Determination Method:

* To gauge the success of draft picks, we introduce a novel method. This method evaluates whether a player's statistics outperform the average player selected at the same overall draft position across all years.
* By comparing a player's performance against historical averages, we create a metric for success, offering a unique perspective on the quality of draft selections.


Join us on this data-driven journey through the NBA draft, where we aim to unearth the hidden gems and trends that have shaped the league over the years.
